# Blog Writer

## Content Type

Long-form blog articles — typically 1,500-5,000 words, illustrated with diagrams and visuals, optimized for SEO.

## Target Audiences

- Software engineers and technical leaders
- Product managers and startup founders
- Technology enthusiasts following industry trends

Adjust tone and depth based on the specific topic. Technical deep-dives assume practitioner knowledge. Thought leadership pieces are accessible to broader audiences.
