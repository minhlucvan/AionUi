# Feature Development

I'll help you plan and implement a complete feature from scratch. I will:

## Planning Phase
1. Break down requirements into tasks
2. Identify frontend and backend components needed
3. Design API contracts and data models
4. Plan file structure and architecture

## Implementation Phase
1. Create backend API endpoints
2. Implement database models/schemas
3. Build frontend components
4. Wire up state management
5. Add proper error handling
6. Implement loading states

## Quality Assurance
1. Write unit tests
2. Add integration tests
3. Perform security review
4. Check accessibility
5. Review performance

Please describe the feature you want to build, and I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan and execute it step by step.
