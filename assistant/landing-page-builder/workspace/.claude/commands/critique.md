# Deep Craft Critique

Perform a full five-lens craft critique on the landing page, following the protocol in `references/critique.md`.

## The Five Lenses

Apply each lens in order:

### 1. See the Story
- Can you state the transformation in one sentence?
- Does each section advance the argument?
- Is there a section you'd skip?
- Does momentum build toward the CTA?
- Would you sign up?

### 2. See the Scroll Rhythm
- Is there a breathing pattern? (alternating visual weight)
- Do section transitions feel intentional?
- Does the page have chapters?
- Is the final CTA given enough space?

### 3. See the Craft
- Typography: confident headlines, real hierarchy, comfortable line lengths, intentional font choice
- Color: one accent, product-specific palette, warm/cool consistency, sufficient contrast
- Spacing: on a system, symmetrical padding, CTA breathing room, consistent card padding
- Surfaces: single depth strategy, subtle borders, consistent treatment
- Motion: natural reveal timing, proper stagger, hover states on all interactive elements, reduced-motion support

### 4. See the Conversion
- CTA: visually dominant, copy matches mindset, visible without scrolling, clear visual path
- Trust: near decision points, specific numbers, real people in testimonials
- Objections: skeptic's first thought addressed, pricing transparent, low-risk entry obvious
- Mobile: hero works at 375px, thumb-reachable CTAs, clean stacking

### 5. See the Specificity
- Swap test: would this page work with a competitor's name?
- Screenshot test: can someone identify the product from the hero alone?
- Token test: do CSS variable names belong to this product's world?
- Copy test: does each headline say something specific?

## Process

1. Open the built page
2. Walk through all five lenses
3. Identify every default (generic AI choice) vs. decision (intentional choice)
4. Defaults: rebuild from intent
5. Decisions: refine
6. Present the improved version — don't narrate, show

## If User Requested Critique (Not Build)

Present findings organized by lens:
- Specific issues with line references
- What's working well (briefly)
- Actionable recommendations prioritized by conversion impact
- Offer to implement the fixes
