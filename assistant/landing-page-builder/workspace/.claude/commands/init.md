# Initialize Landing Page Direction

Before doing anything, read the full SKILL.md at `.claude/skills/landing-page-builder/SKILL.md` and the reference files in `references/`. These contain the complete methodology.

## Your Task

Initialize a landing page direction for the user's product. This means:

1. **Ask the Three Required Questions:**
   - What transformation does this product promise?
   - Who specifically arrives on this page, and what are they feeling?
   - What would make them stop scrolling and pay attention?

2. **Product World Exploration:**
   - Map the product's domain to visual concepts (5+ real-world metaphors)
   - Define the color mood (5+ colors that naturally exist in this domain)
   - Define the motion language (snappy/fluid/mechanical/organic)
   - Find the signature element — one visual that no template would generate

3. **Anti-Defaults:**
   - Identify 3 obvious layout choices to reject
   - Identify 3 obvious copy patterns to reject

4. **Section Choreography:**
   - Plan the scroll sequence: which sections, in what order, with what purpose
   - Define the breathing pattern (visual weight per section)

5. **Propose a Direction:**
   - Present the visual world, token naming approach, and hero concept
   - Get user confirmation before building

## Communication

- Be concrete. Propose a specific direction rather than asking open-ended questions.
- Use "Suggest + Ask" — offer your recommendation, then ask for confirmation.
- If `.landing-page/system.md` already exists, read it and report its state.

## After Initialization

Offer to:
- Build the hero section first
- Save the direction to `.landing-page/system.md`
- Show a section-by-section build plan
