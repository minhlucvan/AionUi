# Create 3D Scene Command

Create a complete Three.js scene with all necessary components for 3D game development.

## Task

Create a new Three.js scene with:
1. HTML file with canvas setup
2. JavaScript file with scene, camera, and renderer configuration
3. Basic lighting setup (ambient + directional)
4. Orbit controls for camera interaction
5. Animation loop with proper timing
6. Responsive canvas handling
7. Stats.js for performance monitoring

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `index.html` with canvas element and script imports
2. Create `main.js` with Three.js scene setup
3. Configure camera with appropriate FOV and position
4. Set up WebGL renderer with antialiasing and proper pixel ratio
5. Add lighting (ambient + directional with shadows)
6. Implement OrbitControls for camera interaction
7. Create animation loop with requestAnimationFrame
8. Add window resize handler
9. Add Stats.js for FPS monitoring

## Expected Output

A fully functional Three.js scene that:
- Renders at 60 FPS
- Has interactive camera controls
- Displays performance stats
- Handles window resizing properly
- Has proper lighting and shadows
- Is ready for adding 3D objects and game logic

## Example Usage

After running this command, you'll have:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `main.js` - Three.js scene setup
- A working 3D scene ready for development
