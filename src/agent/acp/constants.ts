/**
 * OpenCode: AionUi integrates with the TypeScript version (anomalyco/opencode)
 * which has full ACP protocol support via `opencode acp` command.
 *
 * Note: There are two OpenCode projects:
 * - TypeScript version: https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode (actively maintained, recommended)
 * - Go version: https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode (archived, migrated to Crush by Charm team)
 *
 * Both versions support `opencode acp` command, so the integration is compatible with either.
 * Currently, OpenCode does not support --yolo flag for auto-approve mode.
